          <p class="paragraph">
            Working as a frontend developer with the Volvo Cars website. My work was mainly focused on developing
            consumer-end modules, written with react which was then fed content via a headless CMS and using GraphQL for
            getting the data.
            Working on such a big site gave me useful insights in large scale architecture, development and devops as
            well as it taught me how to really scale without losing the core concepts of flexible and maintainable code.
            The frontend was developed with React on Next.js in a large mono-repo with approximately 50 sites. The core
            concepts were based on sharing modules across the sites while still doing core implementation of them per
            site. All modules had to be written in a way they had multi language support and were fed their content from
            the headless CMS. As for data fetching for the components we used GraphQL to fetch data and then feed that
            to the components.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            One module I developed was a component that could calculate the total cost of ownership for different cars
            based on things like the benefit in kind value, leasing cost, mileage and so on. This really helped increase
            the conversion rate on our signups.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            During my time I really focused on getting us as a team to collaborate more, making us much more efficient.
            Sharing knowledge and experiences really helped us on achieving otherwise tough tasks. It also made us
            perform faster and with higher quality.

            The job was to build a new app and build components which later will be consumed by developers of the

          <p class="paragraph">
            Working with the front end framework at Skandia, used by all internal and external sites within the company.
            The job consisted of working tightly with the UX team to create and maintain components used by other teams
            internally. Because the framework needed to be generic it had to be structured according to strict
            principles and easy to understand design patterns. The components also needed to be consumable in everything
            from more traditional "static" code to modern frameworks (eg. React). All code was written as clean as
            possible with HTML5, CSS3 and ES6/Typescript
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            A big part of the job has been porting the old framework to a more modern stack. The old jQuery code was
            extracted to a version with strict separation of markup, design and logic. The new components were built
            using a tweak on how bootstrap structured their components and with more generalization to enable extraction
            to external consumable components.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            One project has been to support the internal developers at Skandia during the redesign of the internet bank
            pages. The goal was to make the pages in the internet bank to look, feel and behave just like the pages on
            skandia.se
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Another project was building a new version of the front end framework in React. It was very important to
            build the components so they could be used by several teams and at the same time meet their specific
            requirements. I also acted as a mentor for other developers within my team and other teams regarding
            questions on javascript and the React framework.

            Working with ASP.NET C# and VB.NET from version 2.0 to 4.5. In my role at AFA I acted as a mentor for many
            of the developers. I have held workshops and lectures on multiple occasions for the developers. I worked on
            ten different projects.

          <p class="paragraph">
            I rebuilt the internal case management and time reporting systems. The goal was to increase performance but
            also to follow web-standards and remodel and normalize the data.

          <p class="paragraph">
            Another system I worked on was the biggest and one of the most important of AFA's systems which handles
            registration of work related injuries and accidents. One job was to build a solid translation solution for
            the system.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            The system had over 200 pages and a lot of internal keys were to be translated. The solution was to build a
            flexible system where you could translate the system directly in the system itself. Because the code of the
            system to be translated was very old and unstructured a lot of refactoring had to be made to get the new
            solution to work. When I quit the system had been translated in 10 languages and the number of visitors was
            20.000 unique logins per week.
